User will specify choices in the input file , like number of rooms, his/her budget, personal information (Name, Address).


Tool is based on python language, essentially a python package "selenium" which automatically searches objects in websites given above with user defined properties (location, price, room numbers, etc.) and fills the forms then sends messages defined by the user as a template before.

Here is the selenium package:

You will need a driver for your browser to execute this tool. Drivers are executable files. 

For example, for a Chrome browser, you will need a Chrome driver for selenium compatible with your browser's version.

Let's have a look... 

How to see the Chrome version:

How to download a Google Driver for Selenium:

1) Go to the page:  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

2) Select the aprropriate executable file download link, as depicted below:

----------------------

After having your Selenium driver, you can download now the entire repo to your local machine. 


You will fill in the file called "UserDataInput.txt" in the working directory.

Another important issue:
In "UserDataInput.txt" file, the last line is reserved for Chrome user profile path which is important to get rid of privacy settings pop ups in the absensce of any cookies, disabling selenium work properly.

How to set User Profile for Chrome: 

1) type in your browser this:   chrome://version/  

2) find in the page the necessary path:

Output folder --> log files, with information on the objects focused (the ones that you will find and send messages) with web scraping packages of python. 

Output folder --> sub directory: ExtractedEmails  --> Possible email addresses on the object urls, program will ask you in the end to check the email addresses in the files in this sub-directory, to validate them in order to send extra emails automatically with a personalized, good looking way. You can validate those emails via the url provided in the files. If you think that some/all emails are not valid, only delete those emails from the files without deleting other things. 


Last Notes:

It is free to download and use. In case of any bugs, errors, please contact to the author:

Mostly Chrome driver is used to develop the tool. Recommended to use Chrome. Other browser options are only set up in the code sections for future implementations.
